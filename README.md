This task involves connecting an LED to the Arduino mega microcontroller and then the main task is to display numbers from 0 onwards on the serial monitor. The timer is used to calculate precise timing to toggle the LED alternatively between on and off. Here, the delay is not a software delay but a delay that is generated by the interrupt. Bare metal programming is used here.
